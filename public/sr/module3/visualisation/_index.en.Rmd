Most of you, if not all, will be familiar with creating graphs in Excel. Software such as Excel has a predefined set of menu options for plotting the data that is the focus of the end result: "pretty graph". Those types of menus assume data to be in a format ready for plotting, which when you get raw data is hardly the case. You are probably going to have to organise and wrangle your data to make it ready for effective visualisation. 

**Grammar of Graphics**

The [grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) enables a structured way of creating a plot by adding the components as layers, making it look effective and attractive. 

It enables you to specify building blocks of a plot and to combine them to create the graphical display that you want. There are 8 building blocks:

- data

- aesthetic mapping

- geometric object

- statistical transformations

- scales

- coordinate system

- position adjustments

- faceting

Imagine talking about baking a cake and adding a cherry on the top. üéÇüçí This philosophy has been built into the [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) package by [Hadle Wickham](http://hadley.nz) for creating elegant and complex plots in R.

---

**`ggplot2`**

Learning how to use the `ggplot2` package can be challenging, but the results are highly rewarding and just like R itself, it becomes easier the more you use it.

{{% notice warning %}}
Unlike base graphics, ggplot works with dataframes and not individual vectors.
{{% /notice %}}

The best way to master it is by practising. So let us create a first `ggplot`. üòÉ
What we need to do is the following:

i. Wrangle the data in the format suitable for visualisation.
ii. "Initialise" a plot with `ggplot()`:
  
**ggplot(<span style="color:blue">dataframe</span>, aes(<span style="color:orangered">x = explanatory variable</span>, <span style="color:green">y = response variable</span>))**

This will draw a blank ggplot, even though the x and y are specified. `ggplot` doesn‚Äôt assume the plot you meant to be drawn (a scatterplot). You only specify the data set and columns ie. variables to be used. Also note that `aes( )` function is used to specify the x and y axes. 
  
- iii) Add layers with `geom_` functions:

**geom_point()**

 We will add points using a **geom layer** called `geom_point`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
# load the packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))

# wrangle the data (Can you remember what this code does?)
gapminder_pipe <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe" & year ==  2007) %>%
  mutate(pop_e6 = pop / 1000000)

# plot the data
ggplot(gapminder_pipe, aes(x = pop_e6, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(col ="red")
```

{{% notice tip %}}
ü§ìüí° **Tip**: You can use the following code template to make graphs with **ggplot2**:
{{% /notice %}}

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>, (mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + 
      <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

**<span style="color:red">ggplot()</span> gallery**
Run the following code to see what graphs it will produce.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = lifeExp), binwidth = 10) +
  geom_histogram()
#
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density()
#
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = continent, color = continent)) +
  geom_bar()
#
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = continent, fill = continent)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

 üó£üë• Confer with your neighbours: 
Does life expectancy depend upon population size?

$$y = b_0 + b_1 x + e$$

Run this code in your console to fit the model `pop` vs `lifeExp`.

Pay attention to spelling, capitalization, and parentheses!
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
m1 <- lm(gapminder_pipe$lifeExp ~ gapminder_pipe$pop_e6)
summary(m1)
```

**Can you answer the question using the output of the fitted model?**
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
m1 <- lm(gapminder_pipe$lifeExp ~ gapminder_pipe$pop_e6)
summary(m1)
```

---

üëâ Practice ‚è∞üíª: Use gapminder data.

Does life expectancy depend upon the GDP per capita?

1) Have a glance at the data. (tip: `sample_n(df, n)`)

2) Produce a scatterplot: what does it tell you?

3) Fit a regression model: is there a relationship? How strong is it?
Is the relationship linear? What conclusion(s) can you draw?

4) What are the other questions you could ask; could you provide the answers to them?

üòÉüôå Solution: code Q1; sample
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
sample_n(gapminder, 30)
```

We will add layers onto this scatterplot: `liveExp` vs `gdpPercap`. We want to superimpose regression line of the best fit and non-parametric loess line that depict a possible relationship between the two variables. That means we will have:

- 1st layer: **scatterplot**
- 2nd layer: **line of the best fit**
- 3rd layer: **loess curve**


 üòÉüôå Solution: code Q2; Plot the data;
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 21, fill = "blue", colour="black", size = 5) + # set transparency, shape, colour and size for points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "maroon3") + # change the colour of line
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "limegreen") # change the colour of line
```

üòÉüôå Solution: code Q3; simple regression model
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
my.model <- lm(gapminder_pipe$lifeExp ~ gapminder_pipe$gdpPercap)
summary(my.model)
```

**Playing with the aesthetic:** adding more layers to your <span style="color:red">`ggplot()`</span>

Whenever possible you should strive to make your graph visually appealing and informative as discussed in the previous section *Principles of Visualisation*. 

**To change the title and axis labels use <span style="color:orangered">layer `labs`</span>**

**labs(<span style="color:blue">title =</span> <span style="color:orangered"> ‚Äúyour title‚Äù</span>, <span style="color:blue">subtitle =</span> <span style="color:orangered"> ‚Äúyour subtitle‚Äù</span>, <span style="color:blue">y =</span> <span style="color:orangered"> ‚Äúy label‚Äù</span>, <span style="color:blue">x =</span> <span style="color:orangered"> ‚Äúx label‚Äù</span>, <span style="color:blue">caption =</span> <span style="color:orangered"> ‚Äúgraph's caption‚Äù</span>)** 
 

```{r, echo = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 20, col = "steelblue", size = 5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "limegreen") + 
 
  # give a title an label axes
  labs(title = "Life Exp. vs. Population Size", 
        x = "population", y = "Life Exp.") + 
  
  # modify the appearance
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  
  # add the description
  geom_text(x = 80000, y = 125, label = "regression line", col = "maroon3") +
  geom_text(x = 90000, y = 75, label = "smooth line", col = "limegreen") 

```

Note, that we have added text on the plot for the two lines and have edited the plot in terms of legend and its appearance.

We could also annotate the plot by using:
```
annotate("text", x = 80000, y = 125 label = "regression line", color = "maroon3")
```

To learn more about how to modify the appearance of the theme go to [ggplot‚Äôs theme page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html).

**Change the colour of the points to reflect categories of another, third variable.**

```{r, echo = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  
  # change the colour of the points to reflect continent it belongs to; set transparency, shape, and size for points
  geom_point(aes(col = continent), alpha = 0.5, shape = 20, size = 3) + 
  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "dodgerblue3") + 
  labs (title= "Life Exp. vs. Population Size", 
        x = "population", y = "Life Exp.") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  geom_text(x = 80000, y = 125, label = "regression line", col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_text(x = 90000, y = 75, label = "smooth line", col = "dodgerblue3")
```

{{% notice note %}}
Note that the legend is added automatically. You can remove it by setting the **legend.position** to `none` from within a `theme()` function.

**Adjust the X and Y axis limits and change the X axis texts and its ticks' location**

```{r, echo = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
  ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = continent), alpha = 0.5, shape = 20, size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "dodgerblue3") + 
  labs (title= "Life Exp. vs. Population Size", 
        x = "population", y = "Life Exp.") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  geom_text(x = 48000, y = 90, label = "regression line", col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_text(x = 70000, y = 75, label = "smooth line", col = "dodgerblue3") +
  
  # change the limits of the x & y axis
  xlim(c(0, 90000)) + 
  ylim(c(25, 100)) 
```
  
Note that the regression and smooth lines have changed their shapes üò≥‚Ä¶ all those warnings üò¨ What‚Äôs going on?! üò≤
  
{{% notice warning %}}
When using xlim() and ylim(), the points outside the specified range are deleted and are not considered while drawing the line using `geom_smooth()`. This feature might come in handy when you wish to know how the line of best fit would change when some extreme values or outliers are removed.
{{% /notice %}}
  
Thankfully, there is another way to change the limits of the axis without deleting the points by simply zooming in to the region of interest. This is done using `coord_cartesian()`. You can try to replace `xlim()` and `ylim()` commands in the previous code chunk with the code below to see what would happen.

```
coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 90000), ylim = c(25, 100))  # zooming in specified limits of the x & y axis
```

You can set the breaks on the x axis and label them by using `scale_x_continuous()`. Similarly, can you can do it for the y axis? 

Try to play with changing the colour palette. For more options check [Sequential, diverging and qualitative colour scales from colorbrewer.org](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html).

These are build-in themes which control all non-data display. You should use `theme_bw()` to have white background or `theme_dark()` for dark grey. For more build-in themes click [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html).


```{r, echo = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = continent), alpha = 0.5, shape = 20, size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "dodgerblue3") + 
  labs (title= "Life Exp. vs. Population Size", 
        x = "population", y = "Life Exp.") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  geom_text(x = 80000, y = 125, label = "regression line", col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_text(x = 90000, y = 75, label = "smooth line", col = "dodgerblue3") +
  
  # change breaks and label them 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 120000, 20000), labels = c("0", "20K", "40K", "60K", "80K", "10K", "12K")) +

  # change color palette
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 

  # white background theme
  theme_bw()
```

There is a `ggthemes` library of themes that willhelp you create stylish ggplot charts used by different journals like the Wall Street Journal or the Economist. See what other themes you can use by going to [this website]( https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/)

```{r, echo = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
## If you don't have ggthemes installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packeges("ggthemes")
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = continent), alpha = 0.5, shape = 20, size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "darkred") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "darkgreen") + 
  labs (title= "Life Exp. vs. Population Size", 
        x = "population", y = "Life Exp.") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  geom_text(x = 80000, y = 125, label = "regression line", col = "darkred") + 
  geom_text(x = 90000, y = 75, label = "smooth line", col = "darkgreen") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 120000, 20000), labels = c("0", "20K", "40K", "60K", "80K", "10K", "12K")) +

  # Wall Street Journal theme
  scale_colour_wsj() +
  theme_wsj()
```

You are ready to make publication-ready visualizations in R. üòé You can go further and explore for yourself to see if you can produce BBC style ggplot charts like those used in the BBC's data journalism.

**Lay out panels in a grid**

Sometimes it might be hard to read one panel plot, like the one we have just created in which it is not very easy to see the points of each continent. To make it easier to follow and to understand the information you are trying to depict, it would be more effective to present different categories of the same information in a clear set of multi-panel plots. This is easy to do by applying powerful faceting functions of the `ggplot2`: `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()`.
  
```{r, echo = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = continent), alpha = 0.5, shape = 20, size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "darkred") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "black") + 
  labs (title= "Life Exp. vs. Population Size", 
        x = "population", y = "Life Exp.") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 120000, 20000), labels = c("0", "20K", "40K", "60K", "80K", "10K", "12K")) +
  scale_colour_wsj() +
  theme_wsj() +
  
  # forms a matrix of scatterplots for each continent
  facet_grid(rows = vars(continent))
```
 
The main difference between `facet_wrap()` and  `facet_grid()` is that the former can string together ggplots in different facets using a single variable, while the latter can do it for more than one.

üí™ There is a challenge: 

- `dplyr`'s `group_by()` function enables you to group your data. It allows you to create a separate df that splits the original df by a variable.

- `boxplot()` function produces boxplot(s) of the given (grouped) values.

Knowing about `group_by()` and `boxplot()` function and using `gapminder` data, can you compute the median life expectancy for year 2007 by continent and visualise your result?

üòÉüôå Solution: code

Let us look at the median life expectancy for each continent
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarise(lifeExp = median(lifeExp))
```

**We are lucky that we live in Serbia, ie. Europe!!!** üòÖ

üòÉüôå Solution: graph 

```{r, echo = TRUE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
# visualise the information
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "hotpink") +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0), alpha = .2) +
  labs (title= "Life Exp. vs. Continent", 
        x = "Continent", y = "Life Exp.") +
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

**Case study: NO2 2017 üòÅ**

Let's try to combine everything we have learnt so far and practise using well known to us [2017-NO2.csv](http://data.sepa.gov.rs/dataset/ca463c44-fbfa-4de9-9a75-790995bf2830/resource/74516688-5fb5-47b2-becc-6b6e31a24d80/download/2017-no2.csv) data.

**YOUR TURN üëá**

Practise by doing the following set of exercises:

1) Choose a data set from <https://data.gov.rs> that is interesting to you. Import the dataset into R and examine what kinds of variables are there. What plots would you recommend using to help people get to know the dataset?

2) Go back to NO2 2017 case study:

  i)	What are the questions you can ask based on the available information within the dataset?

  ii)	What plots would you recommend using to help in answering those questions?

  iii)	Create appropriate visualisations for i) & ii)
