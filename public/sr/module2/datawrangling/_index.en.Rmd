**How do we do it?** 🤔

![](/day2/DataWrangling/images/Program_HW.png?width=40pc)

This diagram is taken from the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book by [Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/statgarrett
) and [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham), which it is a great resource for learning R. There is a whole community built around it and you could join it and start learning together: [R4DS online learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/).

**Dataset**

To learn and practise how to organise data we will use a `gapminder` data set available from the `gapminder` package in R. This dataset is put into R by [Jennifer Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) from a tank of data sets available from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org).

[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org) is an independent Swedish foundation that helps to promote sustainable global development by collecting and analysing relevant data and by developing and designing  teaching/learning tools. [Gapminder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapminder_Foundation) was founded in Sweden by [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) who was a mastermind for distinctive and insightful storytelling about global development using visual animation.

You can see Hans in action in this [BBC documentary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02q33dg) [The joy of Stats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdf0k545yDA) available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

**Gapminder Data**

For each of 142 countries, the package provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007.

Before you can take a look at this data set first run the folowing code

```
# install necessary packages:
install.packages("dplyr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("ggplot2", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("gapminder", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

```{r}
# have a look at the data 
head(gapminder::gapminder)
```

{{% notice note %}}
💡Note that there are 6 columns, each of which we call a variable.
{{% /notice %}}

**Description**: Excerpt of the Gapminder data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country.

The main data frame gapminder has **1704 rows** and **6 variables**:
- **country**: factor with 142 levels
- **continent**: factor with 5 levels
- **year**: ranges from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years
- **lifeExp**: life expectancy at birth, in years
- **pop**: population
- **gdpPercap**: GDP per capita

```{r}
gapminder::gapminder[1:3,]
```

1st look at the data using the following functions: <span style="color:red">`dim()`</span> & <span style="color:dim">`head()`</span>

```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
head(gapminder, n=10)
```

Can you tell what each of the two functions does?! 

Do we have the information about the structure of the data? 🤔 We can examine the structure using <span style="color:red">`str()`</span> function, but the **output could look messy** and hard to follow if the data set is big. 🤪

```{r}
str(gapminder) 
```

---

**The `dplyr` Package**

The <span style="color:red">**`dplyr`**</span> provides a “grammar” (the verbs) for data manipulation and for operating on data frames in a tidy way. The key operator and the essential verbs are:

<span style="color:red">%>%</span>: the “pipe” operator used to connect multiple verb actions together into a pipeline.

<span style="color:red">select()</span>: return a subset of the columns of a data frame.

<span style="color:red">mutate()</span>: add new variables/columns or transform existing variables.

<span style="color:red">filter()</span>: extract a subset of rows from a data frame based on logical conditions.

<span style="color:red">arrange()</span>: reorder rows of a data frame according to single or multiple variables.

<span style="color:red">summarise() / summarize()</span>: reduce each group to a single row by calculating aggregate measures.

We can have a look at the data and its structure by using the <span style="color:red">`glimpse()`</span> function from the `dplyr` package.

```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
glimpse(gapminder) 
```

{{% notice note %}}
🤓💡: Notice how we can prevent display of the messages that appear when uploading the packages by using, in this case, `suppressPackageStartupMessages()`!
{{% /notice %}}

Now we have the `dplyr` package uploaded, let us learn its verbs. 😇

**The pipeline operater:** <span style="color:red">`%>%`</span>

**Left Hand Side (LHS)**   <span style="color:red">`%>%`</span>    **Right Hand Side (RHS)**

<span style="color:red">x %>% f(..., y)</span> 

<span style="color:red">    f(x,y)</span>

The "pipe" **passes the result of the *LHS as the 1st operator argument of the function on the RHS**.

<pre>
<span style="color:red">3 %>% sum(4)</span>      <==>      <span style="color:red">  sum(3, 4)</span>
</pre>

<span style="color:red">`%>%`</span> is very practical for chaining together multiple <span style="color:red">`dplyr`</span> functions in a sequence of operations.

---

**Pick variables by their names:** <span style="color:red">`select()`</span>,

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/select().png")
```

- <span style="color:red">`starts_with("X")`</span> every name that starts with "X".

- <span style="color:red">`ends_with("X")`</span> every name that ends with "X".

- <span style="color:red">`contains("X")`</span> every name that contains "X".

- <span style="color:red">`matches("X")`</span> every name that matches "X", where "X" can be a regular expression.

- <span style="color:red">`num_range("x", 1:5)`</span>  the variables named x01, x02, x03, x04, x05.

- <span style="color:red">`one_of(x)`</span> => every name that appears in x, which should be a character vector.

---

👉 Practice ⏰💻: Select your variables 

1) that ends with letter `p`

2) starts with letter `co`. Try to do this selection using base R.  

😃🙌 Solutions:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gm_pop_gdp <- select(gapminder, ends_with("p"))
head(gm_pop_gdp, n = 1)
gm_cc <- select(gapminder, starts_with("co"))
head(gm_cc, n = 1)
```

of course all of this could be done using **base R** for example:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gm_cc <- gapminder[c("country", "continent")]
```

but it's less intuitive and often requires more typing. 

---

**Create new variables of existing variables:** <span style="color:red">`mutate()`</span>

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mutate().png")
```

It will allow you to add to the data frame `df` a new column, `z`, which is the multiplication of the columns `x` and `y`: `mutate(df, z = x * y)`.
If we would like to observe `lifeExp` measured in months we could create a new column `lifeExp_month`: 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder2 <- mutate(gapminder, LifeExp_month = lifeExp * 12) 
head(gapminder2, n = 2)
```

---

**Pick observations by their values:** <span style="color:red">`filter()`</span>
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/filter().png")
```

There is a set of logical operators in **R** that you can use inside `filter()`:

- `x < y`: `TRUE` if `x` is less than `y`
- `x <= y`: `TRUE` if `x` is less than or equal to `y`
- `x == y`: `TRUE` if `x` equals `y`
- `x != y`: `TRUE` if `x` does not equal `y`
- `x >= y`: `TRUE` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`
- `x > y`: `TRUE` if `x` is greater than `y`
- `x %in% c(a, b, c)`: `TRUE` if `x` is in the vector `c(a, b, c)`
- `is.na(x)`:  Is `NA`
- `!is.na(x)`: Is not `NA`

---

👉 Practice ⏰💻: Filter your data

Use `gapminder2` `df` to filter:

1) only European countries and save it as `gapmEU`

2) only European countries from 2000 onward and save it as `gapmEU21c`

3) rows where the life expectancy is greater than 80

Don't forget to **use `==` instead of `=`**! and
Don't forget the quotes **`""`**


 😃🙌 Solutions:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU <- filter(gapminder2, continent == "Europe") 
head(gapmEU, 2)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU21c <- filter(gapminder2, continent == "Europe" & year >= 2000)
head(gapmEU21c, 2)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
filter(gapminder2, lifeExp > 80)
```

---

**Reorder the rows:** <span style="color:red">`arrange()`</span>
is used to reorder rows of a **d**ata **f**rame (df) according to one of the variables/columns.

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/arrange().png")
```

- If you pass `arrange()` a character variable, **R** will rearrange the rows in alphabetical order according to values of the variable. 

- If you pass a factor variable, **R** will rearrange the rows according to the order of the levels in your factor (running `levels()` on the variable reveals this order).

---

 👉 Practice ⏰💻: Arranging your data
1) Arrange countries in `gapmEU21c` `df` by life expectancy in ascending and descending order.

2) Using `gapminder df`
  - Find the records with the smallest population
  
  - Find the records with the largest life expectancy.

 😃🙌 Solution 1):
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU21c_h2l <- arrange(gapmEU21c, lifeExp)
head(gapmEU21c_h2l, 2)
gapmEU21c_l2h <- arrange(gapmEU21c, desc(lifeExp)) # note the use of desc()
head(gapmEU21c_l2h, 2)
```

 😃🙌 Solution 2):
```{r, echo = TRUE}
arrange(gapminder, pop)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
arrange(gapminder, desc(lifeExp))
```

**Collapse many values down to a single summary:** <span style="color:red">`summarise()`</span>

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/summarise().png")
```

The syntax of summarise() is simple and consistent with the other verbs included in the `dplyr` package.

- uses the same syntax as `mutate()`, but the resulting dataset consists of a single row instead of an entire new column in the case of `mutate()`. 

- builds a new dataset that contains only the summarising statistics.

| Objective | Function                | Description                    |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| basic     | `sum(x)`                | Sum of vector x                |
| centre    | `mean(x)`               | Mean (average) of vector x     |
|           | `median(x)`             | Median of vector x             | 
| spread    | `sd(x)`                 | Standard deviation of vector x |
|           | `quantile(x, probs)`    | Quantile of vector x           |
|           | `range(x)`              | Range of vector x              |
|           | `diff(range(x)))`       | Width of the range of vector x |
|           | `min(x)`                | Min of vector x                |
|           | `max(x)`                | Max of vector x                |
|           | `abs(x)`                | Absolute value of a number x   | 

---

👉 Practice ⏰💻: Use `summarise()`:

1) to print out a summary of gapminder containing two variables: max_lifeExp and max_gdpPercap.

2) to print out a summary of gapminder containing two variables: mean_lifeExp and mean_gdpPercap.

😃🙌 Solution: Summarise your data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
summarise(gapminder, max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp), max_gdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
summarise(gapminder, mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp), mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

---

**Subsetting:** <span style="color:red">`group_by()`</span>

dplyr's `group_by()` function enables you to group your data. It allows you to create a separate df that splits the original df by a variable.

The function `summarise()` can be combined with `group_by()`.

| Objective | Function                | Description                               |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Position	| first()	                | First observation of the group            |
|           | last()	                | Last observation of the group             |
|           | nth()	                  | n-th observation of the group             |
| Count	    | n()	                    | Count the number of rows                  |
|           | n_distinct()	          | Count the number of distinct observations |

👉 Practice ⏰💻: Subset your data

1) Identify how many countries are given in gapminder data for each continent.

😃🙌 Solution: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE,}
gapminder %>%
     group_by(continent) %>%
     summarise(n_distinct(country))
```

---

**Let's `%>%` all up!**

You can try to get into the habit of using a shortcut for the pipe operator 
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pipe_short_cut.png")
```

 🗣👥 Confer with your neighbours: 
What relationship do you expect to see between population size (`pop`) and life expectancy (`lifeExp`)?

*Look what this code produces*

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.align = 'center'}
gapminder_pipe <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe" & year ==  2007) %>%
  mutate(pop_e6 = pop / 1000000)
plot(gapminder_pipe$pop_e6, gapminder_pipe$lifeExp, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
```

---

**`tidyr`**

The `tidyr` can help you to create **tidy data**. Tidy data is data where:

- Every **column** is a **variable**
- Every **row** is an **observation**
- Every **cell** is a **single value**

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyr.png")
```

The `tidyr` package embraces the **principles of tidy data** and provides the standard key functionalities to organise data values within a dataset.

[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) the author of the `tidyr` package talks in his paper [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) about the importance of the data cleaning process and structuring datasets to facilitate data analysis.

Real datasets, that you are most likely to download from <https://data.gov.rs/> or any other open source data platform, would often violate the three precepts of tidy data in all kinds of different ways:

- Variables would not have their names and column headers are values.
-	A number of variables are stored in one column
-	A single variable is stored in several columns 
-	Same information stored multiple times as different variables
 
to name a few.

To illustrate this, let us go back onto <https://data.gov.rs/> and access [Kvalitet Vazduha 2017](https://data.gov.rs/sr/datasets/kvalitet-vazduha-2017/). In particular, we want to access [2017-NO2.csv](http://data.sepa.gov.rs/dataset/ca463c44-fbfa-4de9-9a75-790995bf2830/resource/74516688-5fb5-47b2-becc-6b6e31a24d80/download/2017-no2.csv) data.

```{r}
## If you don't have tidyr installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packeges("tidyr")
library(tidyr)
# access 2017-NO2.csv data
no2 <- read.csv("http://data.sepa.gov.rs/dataset/ca463c44-fbfa-4de9-9a75-790995bf2830/resource/74516688-5fb5-47b2-becc-6b6e31a24d80/download/2017-no2.csv",
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE, 
                fileEncoding = "latin1")
# have a look at the data
glimpse(no2)
```

It shows that this data set has `365` observations and `8` variables. Nonetheless, we need to consider what type of information we have here:

- `date` NO2 measurement taken: given in a single column -> ✅ tidy🙂
- `places` where NO2 measurement was taken: given in several columns -> ❎ tidy🙁
- `NO2` measurements: given in several columns -> ❎ tidy🙁

Hmmm… 🤔 This doesn’t look tidy at all 😳

This data is about measurement level of NO2(µg/m3) in several different towns/places, which means that NO2 is our main response variable. The way in which this variable is given in this data is certainly not tidy. It defeats the key principles of tidy data: **Every column is a variable** and furthermore, **Every row is <span style="color:orangered">NOT</span> an observation**.

It appears that this data has `8` variables, but we have realised that there are only `3`: `date`, `place` and `no2`. To tidy it, we need to **stack it** by turning columns into rows. We are happy with the variable `date` and it should remain as a single column, the other `7` columns we want to convert into two variables: `place` and `no2`.

To make *wide format* data into *tall format* we have to turn columns into rows using `gather()` function.

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gather.png")
```

We will create variable `place` in which we will hold the headers as given in the columns 2:8. The values inside those columns will be saved in the new variable `no2`.

```{r}
new_no2 <- no2 %>%
  gather("place", "no2", -Datum, factor_key = TRUE) # stack all columns apart from `Datum`
glimpse(new_no2)
```

Let us see the names of the places

```{r}
new_no2 %>%
     group_by(place) %>%
     summarise(n())
```

Those names look very messy. We could use function from [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org) package `str_sub()`. To begin with let's remove <span style="color:orangered">.NO2</span> at the end of each name.

```{r}
## If you don't have stringr installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("stringr")
library(stringr)
new_no2$place <- new_no2$place %>% 
    str_sub(end = -5)
glimpse(new_no2)
new_no2 %>%
    group_by(place) %>%
    summarise(n())
```

It still doesn't look right. 😟 This could be a tedious job. 😥 It is no wonder that many data analysts grumble about time spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. It could be a very long and time consuming process, but the more you do it and the more experience you gain the easier and less painful it gets.


Perhaps, you can try to explore other available packages in R that could help you with organising your data into your ideal format. To give you an idea we will show you how it can easily be done when using `forcats::fct_recode()` function.

```{r}
## If you don't have forcats installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("forcats")
library(forcats)
new_no2 <- no2 %>%
  gather("place", "no2", -Datum, factor_key = TRUE) %>% # stack all columns apart from `Datum`
  mutate(place = fct_recode(place, 
                            "NS_Spens" = "Novi.Sad.SPENS.NO2",
                            "BG_Most" = "Beograd.Mostar.NO2",
                            "BG_Vracar" = "Beograd.Vraèar.NO2", 
                            "BG_ZelenoBrdo" = "Beograd.Zeleno.brdo.NO2", 
                            "KG" = "Kragujevac..NO2", 
                            "NI" = "Ni..IZJZ.Ni...NO2",
                            "UZ" = "U.ice..NO2"))
glimpse(new_no2)
```

**YOUR TURN 👇**

Practise by doing the following set of exercises:

1) Install and upload the `rattle` package and see what it does.

2) Create a new R script file to explore `weatherAUS` dataset. 

  i) `select()` variable: `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, `Rainfall` and `Sunshine` by *pipping* the dataset into `dplyr::select() function.
  
  ii) produce a *summary*  using `base::summary()` function of these numeric values.
  
  iii) within this selection filter only those observations where `Rainfall >= 1` and save the results into the computer's memory (ie. save the results as an object).
  
  iv) Try to think of how else you can use other `dplyr` verbs on this `weatherAUS` dataset. Write your question first, before embarking on typing the code.
  
  v) Write a short report on what visualisation you think would be interesting to produce for this `weatherAUS` dataset and why?
